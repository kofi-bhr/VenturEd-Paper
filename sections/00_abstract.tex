% Sentence 1: State the core problem.
This paper investigates the econometric challenge of measuring causal effects when individuals have unobserved, heterogeneous access to opportunities.
% Sentence 2: Describe our approach/model.
We develop a theoretical model where agents choose from latent "invisible sets" and formalize the partial identification framework that arises from this missing data problem.
% Sentence 3: State the main findings.
We prove that treatment effects are not point identified and derive sharp bounds under minimal assumptions. We further show that network homophily exacerbates this identification problem and reduces allocative efficiency.
% Sentence 4: State the implications.
Our findings suggest that many empirical studies may misinterpret null results as a lack of treatment efficacy when they are in fact evidence of access inequality, and we propose a framework for more robust policy evaluation and design.
