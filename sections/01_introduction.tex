\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Motivation and Problem Statement}
% Hook the reader with a relatable real-world example (e.g., college applications, job internships).
% Introduce the core tension: we want to know if a program "works," but we can only run our analysis on the people who were able to access it in the first place.
% Formally state the research question.

\subsection{Contribution and Approach}
% Briefly explain what is new about our paper.
% We are formalizing the "access inequality" problem as an econometric identification problem.
% Preview the model: we model agents with latent choice sets.
% Mention that we connect the theory to both network effects and policy design.

\subsection{Preview of Results and Roadmap}
% Summarize Theorems 1, 2, and 3 in plain English.
% Briefly describe the simulations we will run.
% Outline the structure of the rest of the paper (e.g., "Section 2 reviews the literature...").
