\section{Mathematical Proofs}

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:non_id} (Non-Identification)}
% The full, rigorous proof of Theorem 1 goes here.
% The proof sketch should be in the main text; this is the full version.
% Use the example from the explainer document as a guide for the construction.

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:bounds} (Partial Identification)}
% The full, rigorous proof of Theorem 2 goes here.
% For this paper, it is acceptable to provide the intuition and cite the formal proofs from Manski (2003) if the full derivation is too complex.
% The key is to show *why* the bounds exist and what they depend on.

\subsection{Proof Sketch for Theorem \ref{thm:networks} (Network Effects)}
% The full, rigorous proof of Theorem 3 goes here.
% This can be a more formal version of the intuitive proof sketch.
% It should mathematically link homophily -> correlated choice sets -> reduced variation.

\section{Additional Simulation Results}
% Any extra tables or robustness check figures from the empirical analysis go here.
